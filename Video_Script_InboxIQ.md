| **0:00-0:20** | "Hi, we are Team Console.log. Did you know the average professional spends 28% of their work week just managing email? We chose the 'Smart Email Solutions' problem statement because in an era of AI, our inboxes are stuck in the past. Keyword search is broken, and context is lost." |
| **0:20-0:50** | "Introducing **InboxIQ**—an intelligent email assistant that acts as a second brain. Unlike standard filters, InboxIQ reads and understands the *intent* of your emails. It auto-prioritizes your feed into High, Medium, and Low urgency, and—most importantly—it automatically extracts specific action items, so you never miss a deadline." |
| **0:50-1:20** | "Our approach is built on privacy-first **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**. We use a **Node.js** backend to fetch emails, process them through a local **Llama 3** model to generate vector embeddings, and store them in **Firebase**. When you ask a question like 'What is the status of the budget?', the system retrieves specific paragraphs from past emails to generate an accurate answer." |
| **1:20-1:40** | "We are Team Console.log—Pruthviraj, Sameer, Kartik, and Shreya. We collaborated across the entire stack, combining our skills in Cloud Architecture, AI Engineering, and Product Design to bring InboxIQ to life." |
| **1:40-2:00** | "InboxIQ changes email from a chore into a productivity engine. We aren't just sorting mail; we are reclaiming time. Thank you, this is Console.log, and we are ready for AlgosQuest 2025." |
